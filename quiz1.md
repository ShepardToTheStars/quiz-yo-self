print(output)
```

# Variables and Functions

## 4) The next few questions will use the following code:

```python
def f(x, y):
    return (x * y)

z = f(9, 5)
print(z)
```

#### 4a) Is `f(x, y)` a function or a variable? What are `f`, `x`, and `y`?

#### 4b) What is `z` a function or a variable?

#### 4c) What is the value of `z` that will get printed to the screen?

## 5) The next few questions will use the following code:

```python
def add(x, y):
    return (x + y)

a = add(10, 5)
print(a)

b = add('10', '5')
print(b)
```

#### 5a) What will `print(a)` print to the screen?

#### 5b) What will `print(b)` print to the screen?

#### 5c) Explain why the output of `print(a)` and `print(b)` are different.
